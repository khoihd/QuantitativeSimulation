# QuantitativeFinanceSimulation

This Python project implements ideas and problems from the space of quantitative finance. Some simple quantitative problems with theoretical results will be empirically verified using simulation. Some complex problems will also be simulated.

The goal of the project is to simulate ideas from simple problems to more complex problems. Optimization techniques will be implemented to improve the runtime and space complexity.

Machine learning, reinforcement learning, constraint optimization, etc. ideas will be implemented soon.

The project was initiated at the volunteer time for RND4IMPACT ([https://www.rnd4impact.com](https://www.rnd4impact.com)).
